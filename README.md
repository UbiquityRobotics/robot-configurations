# robot-configurations
A repository to store various robot configurations.

The set of files required for robot configuration are saved in folders here.

You can create a new set of config files which then must be setup for your robot with a tool called  add__new_config.
This tool when used as below sets up a new folder with the default  hostname.local name.  You may supply some other config folder name for tests or other uses by replacing the -d with your folder name.

   ./add_new_config  -d

The configurations are use in assorted Ubiquity Robotics launch files
